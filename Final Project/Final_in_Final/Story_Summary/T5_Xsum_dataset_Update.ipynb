Despite public assurances that the troubles in the Caucasus were coming under control, clashes between extremists and government troops, and some small-scale attacks, have continued.\\nMore disturbingly, extremism has recently started to flare up further north, in some of Russia's central regions, much closer to Volgograd.\\nThis industrial and transport hub is of huge symbolic importance to most Russians. The attacks there, just weeks before the opening of the Winter Olympics, have created unease across Russia. Many are now asking why the country's powerful security services failed to stop the bombers, accusing them of complacency and unprofessionalism.\\nThe threat to the games in Sochi may not be so great: there are hundreds of police officers and military personnel deployed around the area. But the fear is that the bombers may strike elsewhere.\\nThese bombs have been a brutal reminder of that, he says.\\nIn a statement, Russia's foreign ministry did not blame any particular group but called for international solidarity in the fight against \"an insidious enemy that can only be defeated together\".\\nRegional Governor Sergei Bozhenov said the bombings were a \"serious test\" for all Volgograd residents and all Russians.\\nThe president of the International Olympic Committee has expressed full confidence that Russian authorities will deliver \"safe and secure\" Games in Sochi.\\nThe latest explosion took place near a busy market in Volgograd's Dzerzhinsky district.\\nMaksim Akhmetov, a Russian TV reporter who was at the scene of the blast, said the trolleybus was packed with people going to work in the morning rush hour.\\nHe described the scene as \"terrible\", adding that the bus was \"ravaged\" and that there were \"bodies everywhere, blood on the snow\".\\nThe figures given for the number of dead and injured are still fluctuating, but investigators and the Russian health ministry told a news conference that 14 people had been killed.\\nAt least 20 others were injured, and Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the patients were in \"a bad condition with burns, with multiple injuries typical of blast-induced wounds\".\\nShe said the injured include a pregnant woman, two 16 year olds and a baby aged about six months whose parents are assumed dead.\\nThe regional governor has announced five days of mourning for all the victims.\\nThe force of the explosion removed much of the bus's exterior and broke windows in nearby buildings.\\n\"It is now possible to preliminarily say that the explosive device was set off by a suicide bomber - a man whose body fragments have been collected and sent for genetic testing,\" the Investigative Committee said in a statement.\\nCommittee spokesman Vladimir Markin said identical explosives were used in the two bombings, suggesting they were linked.\\nIn response to this second blast in less than 24 hours, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered security measures to be tightened across Russia and in particular in Volgograd.\\nLocal resident Polina Goncharova said the whole city was in shock.\\n\"This is the first time in my life that I have experienced anything like this. I have been crying since I heard about the first bombing, and now the second one today,\" she told the BBC.\\n\"There are very few people on the streets. I am staying at home myself as I'm worried there will be more attacks.\"\\nThe first blast rocked Volgograd-1 station at around 12:45 (08:45 GMT) on Sunday, at a time of year when millions of Russians are travelling to celebrate the New Year.\\nNo group has yet said it was behind the blast.\\nVolgograd was also targeted in October, when a suspected female suicide bomber killed six people in an attack on a bus.\\nAn Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region has led to many attacks there in recent years.\\nInsurgents have also attacked major Russian towns.\\nVolgograd lies about 900km (560 miles) south of Moscow, 650km north of the North Caucasus and 700km north-east of Sochi.</td>\n",
