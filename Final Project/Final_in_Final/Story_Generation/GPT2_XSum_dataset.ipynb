We are together, and we will continue to be together.\" The letter was signed by former US President Bill Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter, who is now President Donald Trump's son-in-law and one of his most senior advisers. In the letter, they wrote: \"We are united in our determination to make America great again. This is why I am so proud to have you as my President-elect. As you know, I have been a big fan of you and your family for a long time. You are a great friend to me and to all of us.

The two letters are the first of their kind to appear on The Times' front page since they were first published in January 2016. Bolton has been appointed by Trump as his deputy national security adviser. He is expected to lead the White House's counter-narratives team, according to a senior administration official. A second letter from Bolton was sent to Trump on Friday. \"I want to thank you all for the work you've done so far in this campaign,\" Bolton wrote. Trump has said he wants to build a wall along the Mexican border, which he has described as a \"great idea\" and \"very, very good idea\". He has also said that he would \"strongly encourage\" Mexican President Enrique Peña to stay in power if he wins the presidency. On Friday, Trump said Mexico would pay for its border wall, saying it would be \"unfair\" for Mexico to \"pay for\" the cost of building the wall. At the same time, he said it was \"disgrace\n",

            "The world has changed dramatically since the end of the Cold War. The world is no longer the same as it once was. There are no more countries in Africa, Asia, Africa and Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa. In fact, there are only a handful of countries that have changed at least as much as they did in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of this change, the number of people who live in poor countries has fallen by more than a third over the past 20 years, according to a new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This is the first time the IMF has looked at the scale of change in a country's economic and political life. It found that the share of poor people living in countries with the lowest levels of income inequality has increased in recent decades. This has been especially true in developing countries, where the gap between rich and poor has grown at an annual rate of almost two-thirds a decade. And it has continued to grow at a rate that is almost twice as fast as the growth rate in developed countries. \"We have seen a dramatic increase in poverty in some countries,\" says the report, which is based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \"It is clear that poverty is not going away, but there is still a lot of work to do to improve it.\" The report's authors say this is partly because of a lack of action by governments have taken on the issue of how to tackle the problem of poverty. So far, they say, \"there has not been a concerted effort to change the way people think about poverty and inequality\". But they are not the only ones who are feeling this way. A new survey of 1,000 people in South Africa has revealed that almost half of them say they do not have enough money to pay for basic necessities, such as food and clothing. One in three says they cannot afford to buy a house, a car or a mobile phone because they have too much money in their pockets. More than one-third of South Africans say their income is too low to make a decent living, while one in five says their incomes are too high. Most of these people are living on less than £5 a week, compared with £6.5m a year ago. They are also more likely to have children, say the survey suggests.\n",

            "\n",
            "It was the first time in their lives that they had ever been together in the same room. But it was also the last time they would see each other again, and again. \"It's been a long time since we've had a child together,\" says one of the men, who has been living with his wife and two of his children for more than a decade. He is the youngest of six children in his family to be born to a mother and a father. They are the oldest of three children to have been born in a single-room house. And they have not been able to see one another since they were born. The men who have lived together for the past two decades have never seen each another again and have no idea how they are going to live together. One of them says: \"I'm so proud of you. You've been so kind to me. I can't thank you enough for all the love you've shown me for so many years. Thank you for everything you have done for me and my family.\" The other man says he is \"very proud\" of how he feels about the way he looks at the time he was born, but he does not think he will ever see their children again because of what he has done to them. In fact, he says, the only thing that has changed for him since he first met them, is that he cannot imagine what it would be like for them to share a room with another man, or a woman, if they did not have the chance to do so. This is not to say that there is nothing wrong with having children. There is no such thing as \"being a good mother\" or \"going to school\". But there are some things that can be said about being a \"good mother\". There are, for example, many people who say they do not know how to cope with the fact that their own children are born without their mother's presence. As a result, it is often difficult for people to understand what is really going on between them and the people they love and care for. For the most part, they don't know what to make of it all. So when they think about their child's birth, how do they feel about it? How\n",
